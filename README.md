# Instrumentation-Course-S2025

This repository contains homework assignments, projects, and lab exercises for the Instrumentation course.

The main focus of this course and repository is on microcontroller programming, specifically using the STM32F103 series. All programming is performed using STM32CubeIDE, a professional integrated development environment designed for STM32 microcontrollers.

The projects include working with precise instrumentation sensors, where sensor interfacing and data acquisition have been carefully implemented. To validate the designs, simulations are conducted using Proteus software, enabling virtual testing of hardware and firmware interactions before actual deployment.
